*Balance your mental health- Research has proven that those who wake up early have shown better mental health symptoms. They are optimistic, satisfied and feel positive about situations. It also lowers the chance of mental illnesses which is usually found in those who go to sleep late and wake up late.*


2. ***Be productive***

*With growth in productivity, an economy is able to produce—and consume—increasingly more goods and services for the same amount of work. Productivity is important to individuals (workers and consumers), business leaders, and analysts (such as policymakers and government statisticians).*

3. ***Drink water***

*Getting enough water every day is important for your health. Drinking water can prevent dehydration, a condition that can cause unclear thinking, result in mood change, cause your body to overheat, and lead to constipation and kidney stones.*

4. ***Listen to music***
